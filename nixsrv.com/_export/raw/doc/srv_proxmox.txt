    # web-admin configuration
        # all web-admin traffic is being proxied through nginx, use https:// urls below to access
        # this is because such configuration greatly reduces attack surface
        # because web-admin application can have LOTS of potenitally vulnerable points
        # so leaving it unprotected facing the internet is not good
        # downside is that there are 2 logins: first through webserver, than thorugh web-admin
