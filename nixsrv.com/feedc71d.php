Windows, Manual Installation

	*  A Very Long Guide

Windows, VirtualBox virtual appliance (preconfigured image in .ova format)

What you will need

	*  VitualBox, a virtual machine player.
	*  putty, terminal emulator.

        <description>Exercise 1. Text Editor, The: vim

In Linux, as in any Unix-like OS, everything is just a file. And Unix philosophy states that configuration files must be human readable and editable. In almost all cases, they are just plain text. So, first things first, you must learn how to edit a text file.</description>

        <description>Exercise 2. Text Viewer, The: less is More

Now you can edit text files, that is nice. But what if you want just to view a text file? Of course, you could use vim for that, but very often it is overkill. And two more thing to consider:

	*  If you want to view really large file, you will want to view it in a program which is as fast as possible.</description>

        <description>Exercise 3. Bash: The shell, .profile, .bashrc, .bash_history

When working with Linux using CLI (command line interface), you are interacting with a program called a shell. All you type is passed to the shell, which interprets what you have typed, does parameters expansion (which is somewhat similar to brace expansion in algebra) and executes programs for you. Shell which we will be using is called</description>

        <description>Exercise 4. Bash: working with files, pwd, ls, cp, mv, rm, touch

In Linux everything is a file. But what is a file? For now it will suffice to say that it is an object which contains some information. It is usually defined like this:

	&quot; A computer file is a block of arbitrary information, or resource for storing information, which is available to a computer program and is usually based on some kind of durable storage. A file is durable in the sense that it remains available for programs to use…</description>

        <description>Exercise 5. Bash: environment variables, env, set, export

Consider the following: you want a program to print out your username. How will this program know it? For this in Linux there are environment variables. What this means is that there are many variables in your shell, many of which are set up automatically, and every time you run a program, some of them  are passed to this program.</description>

        <description>Exercise 6. Bash: language settings, LANG, locale, dpkg-reconfigure locales

In Linux language selection is as simple as an exporting of a variable. That is right, programs decide how to talk to you by looking into this varibale. Of course, for this to work program must support locales and have translation to your language available and installed. Let us see how it works by installing French locale.</description>

        <description>Exercise 7. Bash: redirection, stdin, stdout, stderr, &lt;, &gt;, &gt;&gt;, |, tee, pv

In Linux, everything is just a file. This means that, for console programs:

	*  Keyboard is represented as a file, from which Bash reads your input.
	*  Display is represented as a file, to which Bash writes its output.</description>

        <description>Exercise 8. Bash: more on redirection and filtering: head, tail, awk, grep, sed

Now that you tasted Linux, I will introduce you to the Unix way. Behold.

	&quot; This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</description>

        <description>Exercise 9. Bash: job control, jobs, fg

Linux is a multitasking operating system. This means that there are many programs running at the same time. From user perspective this means that you are able to run several programs simultaneously, and bash surely has tools to control multiple jobs execution for you. To be able to use this feature you need to learn the following commands:</description>

        <description>Exercise 10. Bash: program exit code (return status)

Let us say that you want to copy a directory. You may do it by typing cp -vR /old/dir/path /new/dir/path. After issuing this command you may want to know how did it go. Was the directory copied? Or some error occurred due to the lack of space in destination directory or something else that did go wrong?</description>

        <description>Exercise 11. Bash: wrapping up

Now that you have tasted how working in Linux using CLI feels, your next step is to open your favorite text editor and make yourself the following table. Search those commands and symbols meaning of which you do not know. Warning! For this to work you must type this table by hand. Search for those terms and commands which are new to you.</description>

Introduction to finding documentation

Now that you know how to work with online Linux documentation, I will tell you this: “Online Linux documentation is good, but it just is not enough.” This means that man pages are useful if you already familiar with how a particular program works, but are very unhelpful when you do not.</description>

Often a need arises to execute a program on schedule. For example let us imagine that you need to make a copy of your work every midnight. To accomplish this in Linux there is a special program called cron. It is a demon, which means that is starts when computer is booted up and sits silently in the background, executing other programs for you when time comes. Cron has several configuration files, system-wide, and one per each user. By default users do not …</description>

        <description>Exercise 20. Filesystems: modifying and creating filesystems, tune2fs, mkfs

Let me introduce you to filesystem-related terminology:

	*  Filesystem — a means to organize data expected to be retained after a program terminates by providing procedures to store, retrieve and update data, as well as manage the available space on the device(s) which contain it.</description>

        <description>Exercise 21. Filesystems: changing root directory, chroot

Let me start with another Wikipedia quote:

	&quot;A chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally not access) files outside the designated directory tree. The term</description>

        <description>Exercise 23. Filesystems: security permissions, chown, chmod, umask

It is time to understand Linux filesystems security model. Let us start with quoting Wikipedia article on permissions:

	&quot; Most current file systems have methods of administering permissions or access rights to specific users and groups of users. These systems control the ability of the users to view or make changes to the contents of the filesystem.</description>

        <description>Exercise 26. Networking: packet filter configuration, iptables

Let me start with quoting Wikipedia on iptables:

	&quot; Iptables is a user space application program that allows a system administrator to configure the tables provided by the Linux kernel firewall (implemented as different Netfilter modules) and the chains and rules it stores. Different kernel modules and programs are currently used for different protocols; iptables applies to IPv4, ip6tables to IPv6, arptables to ARP, and ebtables to…</description>

        <description>Exercise 27. Networking: secure shell, ssh, sshd, scp

You may already know that SSH is a network protocol which allows you to login into vm1 over the network. Let us look into in in some detail.

	&quot; Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol for secure data communication, remote shell services or command execution and other secure network services between two networked computers that it connects via a secure channel over an insecure network: a server and a client (running</description>

        <description>Exercise 28. Performance: getting performance stats, uptime, free, top

This exercise is pretty simple. First, what kind of performance stats do we need?

	*  CPU usage stats:
		*  How much is it loaded?
		*  Which processes are using it?

	*  Memory usage stats:</description>

        <description>Exercise 29. Kernel: kernel messages, dmesg

Well, if you made it this far it is time to talk about kernel. We will start this talk with Wikipedia definition of an Operating System kernel:

	&quot; In computing, the kernel (from German Kern, nucleus, core) is the main component of most computer operating systems; it is a bridge between applications and the actual data processing done at the hardware level. The kernel's responsibilities include managing the system's resources (the communication betwee…</description>

        <description>What to do next

Congratulations for making it here, but your journey has only just begun. See the resources below for some ideas on where to go from here.

	*  Read one man page per day. Make it a habit. One random man page every day. There are about 6000 man pages on my notebook right now, so it can be done for years.</description>
