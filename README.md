# Learn Linux the Hard Way

Awesome "Learn __*placeholder*__ the Hard Way" course on Linux.

The original [link][1] is down.  
I'm in progress on this course at the moment, and I plan to fix some typos while working on this material.  
Maybe in future I'll change the material to correspond to more recent versions of linux.   

Thanks a lot to the author of the original material, it's awesome course.
